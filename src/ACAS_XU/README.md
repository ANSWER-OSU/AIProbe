# AIProbe for ACAS Xu

## 1. Enviroment installation
installation step

## 2. Task generator


## 3. Run model on generated task
This script simulation and runs the model on all generated tasks

```
python run.py
```

## 4. Instruction generation
This script runs a parallelized heuristic-guided instruction generation algorithm for simulation environments generated by task generator. It attempts to reproduce transitions from initial to final state.
```
python heuristic_guided_search.py --csv /path/to/peformance_with_accurate.csv --processes 2

```

## 5. Crash analysis
This script analyzes simulation results to identify no of tasks the model failed due to crashes.

```
python crash_summary.py --result_dir /path/to/simulation/results --n_bins 100

```
