# AIProbe
## Problem Statement
Testing whether intelligent agents possess certain capabilities is a major challenge in AI development. Thoroughly evaluating if an agent can demonstrate an expected capability, in a given environment, is essential for building safe, reliable AI systems. However, directly checking for capability achievement can be limited in coverage. The ability to systematically test agents against a wide range of scenarios that target hypothesized capabilities would increase trust in AI systems deployed for real-world use. More rigorous validation of agent capabilities is an important open problem motivated by ensuring AI safety and performance.

## Introduction
We introduce AIProbe, a framework for evaluating whether an agent can follow instructions generated by a custom fuzzer and achieve expected capabilities within a specified environment. Our project utilizes the Mini-Grid environment. By leveraging a fuzzer, we can maximize coverage of various instructions and uncover unexpected behaviors, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the agent's anticipated capabilities. We employ the concept of initial and final states to represent the agent in the environment, providing a feedback mechanism to assess the agent's response to instructions.

## Representing the Environment State 

$$(A,\{k_i\}_{i=0}^{n}, \{D_j\}_{j=0}^{n},\{O_l\}_{l=0}^{n},\{L_m\}_{m=0}^{n})$$

- S is the Environment State.
- A is the Agent State.

$$A = ((P_{\text{init}}, D_{\text{init}}), (P_{\text{dest}}, D_{\text{dest}}), \text{Path})$$

- Defines the agent's starting coordinates: $$P_{\text{init}} = (x_{\text{init}}, y_{\text{init}})$$
- The agent's initial direction or orientation is specified by: $$D_{\text{init}} = \theta_{\text{init}}$$
- The destination coordinates are given by: $$P_{\text{dest}} = (x_{\text{dest}}, y_{\text{dest}})$$
- The path followed by the agent, an array of coordinates, is represented as: $$\text{Path} = [(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)]$$

#### For all keys in the environment, each key's position and pickup status are defined as:
$$\{K_i\}_{i=1}^{n} = \{(x_{\text{init}_i}, y_{\text{init}_i}, K_{\text{status}_i})\}_{i=1}^{n} $$
Where:
$$(x_{\text{init}_i}, y_{\text{init}_i})$$
- represent the initial position coordinates : 

$$(K_{\text{status}_i})$$ 
- is the pickup status of the \(i\)-th key, with:
  - 0 indicating the key has not been picked up,
  - 1 indicating the key has been picked up.

#### For all doors in the environment each door's position and status are defined as:
Each door's position and status are defined as:
$$\{{D_j\}_{j=1}^{m} = \{(x_{j}, y_{j}), D_{\text{status}_j})}_{j=1}^{m}$$

Where:
$$(x_{j}, y_{j})$$
- represents the position coordinates of the j-th door.
 $$(D_{\text{status}_j})$$
- is the status of the j-th door, with:
  - 0 indicating the door is closed,
  - 1 indicating the door is open.

#### For all objects in the environment each object's initial position, pickup status, destination position, and drop status are defined as::
Each object's position and pickup status are defined as:
$$ \{O_k\}_{k=1}^{l} = \{((x_{k}, y_{k}), O_{\text{pickStatus}_k},(v_{k}, w_{k}),O_{\text{dropStatus}_k} )\}_{k=1}^{l} $$

Where:
$$(x_{k}, y_{k}) $$
- represents the position coordinates of the k-th object.
$$(O_{\text{pickStatus}_k})$$ 
- is the pickup status of the k-th object, with:
  - 0 indicating the object has not been picked up,
  - 1 indicating the object has been picked up.
$$(v_{k}, w_{k}) $$
- represents the position coordinates to drop the k-th object.
$$(O_{\text{dropStatus}_k})$$ 
- is the pickup status of the k-th object, with:
  - 0 indicating the object has not been drop up,
  - 1 indicating the object has been drop up.

#### For all lava in the environment ecah  lava cordinatins are defined as:
Each lava tile's position is defined as:
$$\{L_m\}_{m=1}^{o} = \{(x_{m}, y_{m})\}_{m=1}^{o}$$

Where :
$$(x_{m}, y_{m})$$
- represents the position coordinates of the m-th lava tile.

## Env for MiniGrid

`Env` is a custom environment for the MiniGrid framework, designed to simulate a simple exploration task within a grid-based world. This environment divides the grid into four distinct "houses," each separated by walls with doors allowing passage between them. The mission for the agent is to explore all four houses and find a goal placed in one of them.
